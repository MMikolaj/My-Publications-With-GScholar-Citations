# Listing your publications with Google Scholar citation data

## Introduction

The project is about using a R script to extract number of citation from Google Scholar, combining it with xml generated by a reference manager and showing everything in nice formatted way on a html page using javascript.

The result can be seen [here](https://mmikolaj.github.io/My-Publications-With-GScholar-Citations/)

## Automatisation

The R script can be executed regularly to provide updates of the citation on various ways. One way is to use system task scheduler. In this case, a command that will send the updated xml file to the server hostin the website should be added. This can be done with

`RCurl::ftpUpload(what="xml/My_Collection_With_Google_Citations.xml",       to="sftp://username:password@adress/My_Collection_With_Google_Citations.xml")`

Other option is to use github actions. As it is done in this repository on a weekly basis.
